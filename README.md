# Messanger-with-opened-source-code

Tutorial: For all versions before the release one, downloading manually the Python interpreter and the modules (flask, flask-socketio, eventlet) is required. The Alpha and Beta versions require internet connection to work (it's required to download client version of flask-socketio)

All the source code is opened, you are allowed to check and modify it but with only one exception: Always make sure you gave credits to the author ("yourbrolol") and noted the original app name.

The app might lag or use too much memory, that's temporar.

The author of the project is NOT good at coding yet, so there might be some hardcode and errors (big part of the code is written by AI).
